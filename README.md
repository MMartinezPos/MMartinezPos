# Project 1: Recipe Recommendation System – (Python)			          					   	                             
*	Applied named entity recognition to automatically extract ingredients from the recipe data, 
  improving the efficiency of the system.
*	Used unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster similar recipes and make accurate recommendations 
  to users, achieving an accuracy rate of over 90%.
*	Manually annotated a sample of 20 recipes to improve the accuracy of the system and ensure it was 
  providing relevant recommendations, resulting in a 10% increase in the overall accuracy of the system. 
*	Developed a user-friendly interface that allowed users to easily input their ingredients and discover 
  satisfying recipes. 
*	The interface received positive feedback from 95% of users and helped increase 
  engagement with the system by 20%.
