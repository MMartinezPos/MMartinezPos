**`Digital Craftsman (Developer / Software Engineering / Machine Learning)`**

I'm a computer science student with interests in software engineering and machine learning. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I am excited to continue exploring the intersection of technology and problem-solving in the field of machine learning and software engineering, and to use my unique background and skills to make a meaningful impact.

## My Engineering Experiences
 Graph Brain Project, Virginia Commonwealth University ‚Äì Research Assistant 			                     
*	Responsible for working in Python and Sage to add and test dozens of graph functions for 
  computational stability and to support existing mathematical research goals.
*	Collaborated with a team of 5+ researchers to prioritize and address critical issues that were affecting the stability or 
  performance of the code.
*	Developed solutions that were well-received by the team and helped to prevent similar issues from 
  occurring in the future.
  
 Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) ‚Äì Recruitment Chair                      			      
*	Manage chapter recruitment cycle and help maintain relationships with local high schools to 
  provide more information on SHPE and engineering. 
*	Prepared 35 students for the SHPE national conference with resume workshops, elevator pitches, 
  career fair attire, and networking. 
*	Mentor chapter students on professional development, career options and opportunities, academic 
  success and community engagement.

## My Engineering Projects
 Recipe Recommendation System ‚Äì (Python)			          					   	                             
*	Applied named entity recognition to automatically extract ingredients from the recipe data, 
  improving the efficiency of the system.
*	Used unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster similar recipes and make accurate recommendations 
  to users, achieving an accuracy rate of over 90%.
*	Developed a user-friendly interface that allowed users to easily input their ingredients and discover 
  satisfying recipes.
